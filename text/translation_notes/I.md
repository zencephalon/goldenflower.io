## The Celestial Mind

1. The identification of the Way with essence and primal spirit follows the traditions of the Chan school of Buddhism and the northern branch of the Completely Real school of Taoism.

2. Essence is open and spacious, like the sky; life is a quantity of energy, like light. When the text talks about the two eyes guiding attention, it means that both spacelike awareness and specific perception are operative at the same time.
 
3. This passage introduces the idea of a succession of transmitters of the teaching of the golden flower, to link it with the Way of the ancients.

4. The honorific name Taishang (T'ai-shang) refers to the metaphysical reality represented by _Lao-tzu_, legendary author of Tao Te Ching, the basic classic of Taosim. Donghua (Tung-hua) was the teacher of Zhongli Quan (Chung-li Ch'uan), who was the teacher of Lu Yan (Lu Yen). Lu Yan is the "Yan" mentionted in our text; he is regarded as the immediate ancestor of the Compeletely Real (Quanzhen/Ch'uan-chen) school of Taoism, which was founded by his disciples and descendants in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

The teaching of the golden flower itself is attributed to Lu Yan. There are numerous conflicting stories about the life and times of Lu Yan, but in Taoist tradition it is widely believed that he attained immortality and is still alive. Most of the texts attributed to Lu Yan were received by spiritual communications centuries after the founding of the Complete Reality school and were not written by Lu himself.

5. Completely Real Taoism became so influential in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that it attracted many opportunistic followers and imitators. Later many practices originally abandoned by the school were amalgamated with elements of Completely Real Taoism to produce bastardized forms. At the time of the writing of our text, approximately 250 years ago, Completely Real Taoism was almost entirely a name without a reality.
