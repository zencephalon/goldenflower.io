## The Celestial Mind

1. We call Naturalness the Way. The Way has no name or form; we consider it just the essence, just the primal spirit.

2. Essence and life seem invisible, so we associate them with sky and light. Sky and light seem invisible, so we associate them with the two eyes. 

3. Since ancient times, those who realized spiritual immortality all communicated their teaching verbally, transmitting it from individual to individual.

4. Taishang appeared magically to Donghua, and then through a succession the Way came to Yan, then to the southern and northern schools of Complete Reality, which we considered its full flourishing.

5. That movement flourished in the sense that a great many followed it, yet it declined in the sense that its mental communication deteriorated. This has continued up to the present day, when we find it confused and degenerated.

6. Upon an extreme, a reversion occurs. Therefore a certain master Siu extended his kindness to liberate all, especially setting up the teaching of special transmission outside of doctrine. For those who heard, they found it a rare opportunity; those who accepted it formed a religious association in their time. Everyone should respectfully understand the heart of master Siu.

7. First establish a firm foothold in daily activities within society. Only then can you cultivate reality and understand essence.

8. In obedience to a directive, I act as a guide to liberation. Now I bring to light the source message of the golden flower of absolute unity. After that I will explain in detail.

9. The absolute unity refers to what we cannot surpass. There exist very many alchemical teachings, but all of them make temporary use of effort to arrive at effortlessness; I do not consider them teachings of total transcendence and direct penetration. The doctrine I transmit directly brings up working with essence and does not fall into a secondary method. I consider that the best thing about it.

10. The golden flower represents light. What color does light
